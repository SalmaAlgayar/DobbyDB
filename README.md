# DobbyDB

- Dobby has started to craft his very own DBMS.
- Dobby has tried its best in building the DB, although it ran out of time a little bit and didn't have the chance to develop all the ideas in its imagination. But Dobby acknowledges that it enjoyed every single piece of that project.
- Dobby followed the ANSI SQL syntax at its most simple version.
- Dobby goes smoothly with 'INT', 'FLOAT', and 'VARCHAR' case insensitive datatypes, only, with no specified maximum.
- Dobby can handle only one column inside the 'SET' & 'WHERE' clauses.
- Dobby is case insensitive for the keywords, databases, tables and column names.
- Dobby makes sure that no one evaer dares to violates the primary key constraint uniqueness!
- Dobby is going to improve itself and its database to give it `magic powers` whenever there's free time.

  ```bash
  cd DobbyDB
  ```
  ```bash
  ./main
  ```
Annnnnd, HAVE FUN, Sir!

Enjoy the querying, and whenever you're satisfied, just say to Dobby:
```bash
bye bye
```

Don't be late for us, and frequently come & check for any updates.

Have a nice day.
